# image-filters-image-processing

This project focuses on implementing various image processing filters in both the spatial domain and frequency domain. The spatial domain filters are designed to enhance and manipulate images based on their pixel values, while the frequency domain filters work with the image's frequency components to achieve desired effects.

In the spatial domain, the project provides a collection of smoothing filters for noise reduction, including the median filter, adaptive filter (median, min, or max), averaging filter, and Gaussian filter. These filters are effective in reducing noise and improving the overall quality of images.

The sharpening filters in the spatial domain include the Laplacian operator, unsharp masking and highboost filtering, Roberts Cross-Gradient operators, and Sobel operators. These filters enhance image details and edges, resulting in a more visually appealing and focused image.

Furthermore, the project offers filters specifically designed for handling various types of noise, such as impulse noise (salt and pepper), Gaussian noise, and uniform noise. These filters help to eliminate or reduce the impact of noise on images, resulting in cleaner and clearer outputs.

In the frequency domain, the project includes filters like histogram equalization and histogram specification, which are used for contrast enhancement and improving the overall appearance of images. The Fourier transform, both forward and inverse, is also implemented, allowing users to analyze and manipulate the frequency components of images.

Additionally, the project provides interpolation techniques, including nearest neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic interpolation. These methods are used for resizing and rescaling images while maintaining their visual quality.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive set of image processing filters that can be readily utilized for various applications, including noise reduction, sharpening, noise filtering, contrast enhancement, and image resizing.
